## 📖 About The Project

This is my first software application, where I served as the software developer while collaborating with a team for our final requirement in CPE 0222-1 - SOFTWARE DESIGN (LEC) course. While working alongside team members who contributed to the conceptualization, I took on the complete development responsibility—managing all technical aspects from UI/UX design to full-stack implementation. This project showcases my ability to deliver a comprehensive solution under the pressure of a final academic requirement.
