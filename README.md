# Library-Management-System
This is the first software application I developed, created independently as a requirement for our Software Design course. This project marked my entry into full-stack development, where I handled everything from the planning and design to the final implementation.

The system is a dynamic web platform that modernizes traditional library operations. It allows users to:

Search for books quickly and efficiently

Submit feedback to help improve library services

Reserve books and study rooms with ease

For library staff, it offers tools to:

Track user activity and performance

Make data-driven decisions to optimize operations
