📚 Library Management System
This is the first software application I developed, created independently as a requirement for our Software Design course. It marked my entry into full-stack development, where I took charge of everything—from planning and UI/UX design to backend implementation.

The system is a dynamic web platform that modernizes traditional library operations.
